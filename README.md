## About the Project

<p align = "justify">

The primary objective of this project is to design an autonomous agricultural robot specifically
used for the removal of weed on the real-time basis without any human involvement. This will
help to offer better and nutrients rich yield involving less man-power than the conventional
agriculture. This project can also be extended to design robot various other applications involved
in farming like ploughing, harvesting, etc. in turn making agriculture more autonomous and
providing better yields which in turn will impact on the countryâ€™s GDP and lesser farmer suicide
rates.It is a <b>UG project</b> under guidance of <b>TEQIP-3</b> and <b>ECE Department</b> at <b>SVNIT</b>.

## Folder Organization
![Folder_str](Documents/readme-images/Folder_str.jpg)
<p align = "justify">
 
Mainly project is divided into two part, i.e. Autonomous Navigation & Crop Weed Classification. The main Autonomous-Farm-Robot contains all of the documentation and scripts required for the project, broken down into the four sections: Classification Model, Dataset Analysis, Documentation, and agribot_ws. We have created [Wiki](https://github.com/Dhruv2012/Autonomous-Farm-Robot/wiki "https://github.com/Dhruv2012/Autonomous-Farm-Robot/wiki") for better understanding for our project.

- **Crop_Weed_Classification:** Contains scripts for classification task.
- **agribot_ws:** Catkin workspace for navigation and modelling.
- **Documents:** Documentation of the project. Includes Project Report & Presentation, Proposal, Research Papers etc.
- **Datasets(Git):** For Analysis of Datasets. [Bonn Dataset](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/sugarbeets2016/ "https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/sugarbeets2016/") contains samples with missing images. So, there is a need to remove such samples. We have listed these samples which contains missing images in it.

## Features
### 1. Autonomous Navigation

### 2. Crop Weed Classification

<p align = "justify">

We trained and tested 2 models: UNet & Bonnet on Datasets namely: [CWFID](https://github.com/cwfid/dataset) & [Bonn](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/sugarbeets2016/) . **Bonnet Architecture** by [PRBonn](https://github.com/PRBonn) (Photogrammetry & Robotics Lab at the University of Bonn) can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Dhruv2012/Autonomous-Farm-Robot/blob/master/Documents/Research%20Papers/Crop_Weed_Classification/1709.06764.pdf). Implementation of both architecture is done in `Crop_Weed_ Classification/model.py`. Bonnet performed better than its UNet counterpart and was suitable for real-time deployment due to its approx. 100x lesser parameters compared to UNet. Hence, **Bonnet** was selected as the final classification model.

## Project Build-Map     
![Timeline of Project](Documents/readme-images/Timeline.png)
<p align="justify">
Various Sensor such as NEO-M8N GPS, MPU-9265 and Raspberry PI Cam-v2 were integrated on Nvidia Jetson Nano. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, further development on hardware was not possible. Hence, we shifted our approach on simulation-basis. We tested our software and algorithms through modelling and simulation and have tried to make it close to real-case scenarios. For Eg: Modelling Sensors with noise to create a real-case scenario.
