## About Project
<p align = "justify">
The primary objective of this project is to design an autonomous agricultural robot specifically
used for the removal of weed on the real-time basis without any human involvement. This will
help to offer better and nutrients rich yield involving less man-power than the conventional
agriculture. This project can also be extended to design robot various other applications involved
in farming like ploughing, harvesting, etc. in turn making agriculture more autonomous and
providing better yields which in turn will impact on the countryâ€™s GDP and lesser farmer suicide
rates.It is a UG project under guidance of TEQIP-3 and ECE department at SVNIT.

### Crop Weed Classification
<p align="justify">
We trained and tested 2 models: UNet & Bonnet on [*CWFID*](https://github.com/cwfid/dataset) & [*Bonn*](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/sugarbeets2016/) Datasets. However, implemenatation of **Bonnet Architecture** from Research Paper: [*Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Crop and Weed for Precision Agriculture Robots Leveraging Background Knowledge in CNNs*](https://github.com/Dhruv2012/Autonomous-Farm-Robot/blob/master/Documents/Research Papers/Crop_Weed_Classification/1709.06764.pdf) performed better than its UNet counterpart and was suitable for real-time deployment due to its approx. 100x lesser parameters compared to UNet. Hence, **Bonnet** was selected as the final classification model.
