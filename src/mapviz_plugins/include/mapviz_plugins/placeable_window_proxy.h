/**
 * This object supports moving/resizing a "window" on the canvas.  It
 * should be installed as an event filter on the map canvas and be
 * given an initial rectangle.  It will watch for mouse events that
 * occur within the rectangle and move/resize the rectangle
 * accordingly.  You can listen to signals to determine when the
 * window was moved, or just use the rectangle at the start of every
 * draw.
 *
 * Since this class is designed for moving windows around the canvas,
 * it does everything in terms of pixels.
 *
 * To do: Need to deactivate the proxy when the plugin is marked
 * invisible, or is not drawing data.
